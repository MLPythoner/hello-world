When a man steals your wife, there is no better revenge than to let him keep her.

After marriage, husband and wife become two sides of a coin; they just can't face each other, but still stay together.

By all means marry. if you get a good wife, you'll be happy. If you get a bad wife, you'll become a philosopher.

Woman inspires us to great things and prevents us from achieving them.
